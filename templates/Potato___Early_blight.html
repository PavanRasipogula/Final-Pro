                    splashing rain, irrigation, insects and garden tools. The disease
                    is also carried on tomato seeds and in potato tubers. In spite of

                    stressed plants are attacked.</p>

                  <p>

                  <p>
                    -Keep the soil under plants clean and free of garden debris. Add a
                    layer of organic compost to prevent the spores from splashing back
                    up onto vegetation.

                    before disease normally appears or when weather forecasts predict
                    a long period of wet weather. Alternatively, begin treatment when

                    best results, cover both the tops and undersides of leaves with a
                    thin uniform film or dust. Depending on foliage density, 10 oz
                    will cover 625 sq ft. Repeat applications every 7-10 days, as

                    diseases. For best results, treat prior to foliar disease

                    intervals or as needed.
